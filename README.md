# CRUD Pet Hotel

This app takes pet owner information from a form and inserts it into a database table. It also takes information on pets and inserts it into another database table. As new pets are added, they are appended to the DOM.

## Future updates

In the future, the Update and Delete buttons will be operational. The update button will update the information on the DOM and in the table. The Delete button will remove that pet's information from the visits table, and then also the pets table and the DOM. There will also be a change to the check-in button. When the button is clicked, check-in information will be send to the database table, and the button will change to check-out. Then, when the check-out button is clicked, it will update the database table again and change back into a check-in button.
